        id="StaticFieldLeak"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Do not place Android context classes in static fields (static reference to `ImageCacheManager` which has field `context` pointing to `Context`); this is a memory leak"
        category="Performance"
        priority="6"
        summary="Static Field Leaks"
        explanation="A static field will leak contexts.&#xA;&#xA;Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class. If that outer class is for example a `Fragment` or `Activity`, then this reference means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a reference to the activity which prevents it from getting garbage collected.&#xA;&#xA;Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these longer running instances can cause leaks.&#xA;&#xA;ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts."
