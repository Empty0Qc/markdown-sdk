/Users/quchen/AndroidStudioProjects/markdownsdk/markdown-engine/src/main/java/com/chenge/markdown/engine/ImageCacheManager.kt:22: Warning: Do not place Android context classes in static fields (static reference to ImageCacheManager which has field context pointing to Context); this is a memory leak [StaticFieldLeak]
        @Volatile
        ^

   Explanation for issues of type "StaticFieldLeak":
   A static field will leak contexts.

   Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class.
   If that outer class is for example a Fragment or Activity, then this
   reference means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a
   reference to the activity which prevents it from getting garbage
   collected.

   Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these
   longer running instances can cause leaks.

   ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts.
